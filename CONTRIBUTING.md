## Code of conduct

I don't care if you come off as professional or not, but please try to be kind.

## *I just have a question*.

I prefer it when asked questions in an open format, such as in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ASKurz/Applied-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis-with-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz). That way others can chime in and benefit from the discussion. Other approaches are fine. However, I reserve the right to respond at my own pace.

## *I would like to contribute*.

I'm really not looking for contributions, at this time. However, if you find gross errors or have concerns, feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ASKurz/Applied-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis-with-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues).

## Code style

I generally follow the recommendations in [*The tidyverse style guide*](https://style.tidyverse.org/), but I have a few quirky conventions of my own.
