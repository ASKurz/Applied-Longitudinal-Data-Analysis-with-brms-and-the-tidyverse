This project is based on Singer and Willett's classic (2003) text, [*Applied longitudinal data analysis: Modeling change and event occurrence*](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195152968.001.0001/acprof-9780195152968). You can download the data used in the text at [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/support/singer-willett.html](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/support/singer-willett.html) and find a wealth of ideas on how to fit the models in the text at [https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/examples/alda/](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/examples/alda/). My contributions show how to fit these models and others like them within a Bayesian framework. I make extensive use of Paul Bürkner's [**brms** package](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in **R** using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) via the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) probabilistic programming language. Much of the data wrangling and plotting code is done with packages connected to the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org).

You can find drafts of several of the chapters available as an online book at [https://bookdown.org/content/4253/](https://bookdown.org/content/4253/). Files with drafts included in the online book are listed in the [root directory](https://github.com/ASKurz/Applied-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis-with-brms-and-the-tidyverse) of this GitHub repository. You can find the `.Rmd` files for chapters under development in the [in_the_works](https://github.com/ASKurz/Applied-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis-with-brms-and-the-tidyverse/tree/master/in_the_works) folder. 

There is no anticipated completion data for this project. I’ll update the ebook as new chapters get completed and/or I find reason to make major revisions to those already listed in the root directory. Regardless of the phase of the project, helpful suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/ASKurz/Applied-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis-with-brms-and-the-tidyverse/issues) or make a [pull request](https://github.com/ASKurz/Applied-Longitudinal-Data-Analysis-with-brms-and-the-tidyverse/pulls).
