# Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis with brms and the tidyverse

This project is based on Singer and Willett’s classic text, *Applied longitudinal data analysis: Modeling change and event occurrence*. You can get the data [here](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/support/singer-willett.html) and a wealth of ideas on how to fit their models [here](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/examples/alda/). My contribution will be to show how to do so with Bürkner’s [brms package](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).

I’ll probably eventually get around to stitching this together as an online book with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org). There's no anticipated completion date. Maybe in a year or two. In the meantime, feel free to browse and make suggestions.
